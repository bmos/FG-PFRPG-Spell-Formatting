# Spell Formatting
This extension modifies the character-specific copies of spells (accessed via their actions tab) to allow fully-formatted descriptions including italics, tables (detect magic is a great example), links, etc. At this time, you need to drag the spells into actions after installing this extension for the special formatting to be included.

# Compatibility
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.3.3 (2023-02-21).

# Features
* Spells on the actions tab will display with formatting when opened by clicking the link button.
* Changes to the fully-formatted description will be saved to the plain-text description as well so that they will not be lost if you stop using this extension.
